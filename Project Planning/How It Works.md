I am planning on developing a Happy Wishes webapp that will allow users to send wishes to each other.

Its a web app that allows visitors to wish anyone on their happiest moments. It has the following features:

1. Users can create account and login to the webapp.
2. Users can create a wishing page for anyone or themselves.
3. Each wishing page has a unique url.
4. Any Visitor can post wishes to the wishing page.
4. Any Visitor can view all the wishes on the wishing page.
6. Users can delete the wishes they have sent.
7. Users can edit the wishes they have sent.
9. Users can view the wishes they have received.
10. The wishes are generally text wishes with a maximum of 5000 characters.
11. Visitors can also dedicate songs to the wishing page along with the text wishes.
13. The songs are fetched from audio api.
14. Anyone could viewe and play the dedicated song.
